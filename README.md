# University course: DATA AND WEB MINING
# Task: Prediction and analysis

This project was realised by Andrea Giacomello and Serena Zanon. 

The aim of the project is the prediction of house prices in the given dataset.

In the project, some customised features were added to the dataset in order to enrich the available information and improve the quality of the predictions. 

Subsequently, at least five prediction methods were compared after optimising the parameters of each to ensure the best possible performance. 

In addition, an in-depth analysis was carried out on the instants with the most correct predictions and those with the most incorrect predictions. 

This made it possible to identify any peculiarities in the data and to observe whether there were any particularly strange or out-of-the-ordinary feature distributions 
that could affect the performance of the prediction models.
